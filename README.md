### Client - Server code, with some focus on socketCAN implementation

The code itself is enhanced, just to pass information between Client and Server
in the sense that this is the check-in of the Berkley implementation from the
Y1980s.

Both flavours were tried:

	/* 1) Default protocol IPPROTO_IP (IP in this case) */
	welcomeSocket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_IP);

	/* 2) IPPROTO_TCP (TCP in this case) */
	welcomeSocket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_TCP);

	For 3) UDP (IPPROTO_UDP), there is another code to be designed
	(simplier one),	since UDP pprotocol is connectionless oriented!

There is one catch 22 in the Server code: In the function: 
void get_ip_address(int socket_fd, struct ifreq *ifr):

The string name of the data link interface "enp0s31f6":

	ifr->ifr_addr.sa_family = AF_INET;
	=======> snprintf(ifr->ifr_name, IFNAMSIZ, "enp0s31f6"); <<=======
	ioctl(socket_fd, SIOCGIFADDR, ifr);

should change according to the CLI command: # ifconfig!
